<p>This is the personal portfolio of myself, Johan Lossius, serving as a display of my personal work during Year One of Noroff's Frontend Development Course. However, it was created in such a way that it can potentially be re-purposed after the studies are finished to become a personal portfolio of myself in general or for other personal projects as well.</p>

   <h2>Acknowledgements:</h2>
<p>I'd like to acknowledge Noroff for providing me with a great and flexible study so that I can keep learning while being busy with my own company. What I particularly liked was the pragmatism of the study, free from inapplicable theory that has no other use than to kill creativity, and full of pragmatic tools, tricks and knowledge to be used in the field of frontend development and design.</p>
<p>Also I'd liked to acknowledge the tutors that have helped me along, grading my work and providing feedback and tips when necessary.</p>
